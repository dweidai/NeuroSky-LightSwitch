# NeuroSky-LightSwitch
The automation of home electric device is a new trend for technology advancement. 
Right now, we have smart speakers that follow the user verbal commands; coffee machines would start brewing with a verbal cue.
Learning about the Brain-Computer interactions, especially EEG data interpretation, we are inspired to combine two newly emerged technology. 
What if we can directly control the home automation device with our brain signal? 
Have you ever got yourself into this situation: after an exhausting day, you crawl directly into your bed then notice all the lights that you are too lazy to get up and turn off. 
Now, imagine if you could just think “turn off that light” and the light would be turned off immediately… 
With our vision in mind, we decided to start experimenting on making home light switches into an automation device. 

The project is created with NeuroPy-Python3.0 (https://github.com/dweidai/NeuroPy-Python3.0). Part list includes, Neurosky mindwave mobile 2, arduino uno, xbee, and breadboard.
